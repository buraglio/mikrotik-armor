# mikrotik-armor
## What?
Ansible playbook to perform common hardening funtions on a RouterOS device. This is almost 100% based on the [Manito Networks](https://www.manitonetworks.com/networking/2017/7/25/mikrotik-router-hardening) suggestions for hardening a device. 

## Why?
Why not? Having a much more secure base to start from is useful in saving you unpleasant work later. 

## How?
Install ansible. Clone the repo and adjust the variables, accounting for your own file hierarchy. 
Then run the command: `ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/playbooks/mikrotik-armor.yml`

## To Do
Adjust as necessary

Sometimes I put stuff on my [website](https://www.forwardingplane.net). You can contact me via [email](mailto:buraglio@forwardingplane.net) or [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/buraglio) or [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/buraglio/). I'm not always responsive in a timely manner and probably won't be able to help you do ansible stuff, but generally do eventually reply.
